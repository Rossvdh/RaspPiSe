# RaspPiSe

The Raspberry Pi Sense HAT project (RaspPiSe) aims to engage
and motivate students learning programming in Python at the
University of Cape Town. The target students are Computer Science
students in the CSC1010H course, and Physics students in the
PHY1023H course. We aim to engage the CS students by replacing
some of their traditional assignments with games that they would
implement on the Raspberry Pi and Sense HAT. The Physics students
will be performing experiments implementing code on the
Raspberry Pi and SenseHAT for recording data from the sensors
and then completing questions based on the experiments. We hope
that the students will enjoy these practicals more than the traditional
ones, and thus engage the content more, leading to improved
programming skill.

This repo is for the part of the project targeting CS students. It contains the code for the games that will be used as assignments in the course, as well as the assignment instructions for the students

## Project webpage

The project webiste will be online by the end of October. The literature review, proposal, and final report will be available on the website.

## The snakeWithClass Branch

This branch contains the implementation of the game Snake using a class representing the snake.

Previously it was done with a 3-dimensional list but that got out of hand quickly.


## Other Branches

The master branch contains the scaffolding code and assignment instructions, as used in user testing round one.

The testAssignments branch contains the scaffolding code and assignment istructions as they were used in the second round of user testing.

The secondIteration branch contains the scaffolding code and assignment instructions as they should be given to students should the assignments be used in a course. It also conatins a completed version of the assignment (model answer).
